Abstract = {{The emotion belongs to higher nervous activity in the Cerebral cortex of
   human. Now many researchers use BCI in formal analysis, simulation, and
   phototyping to explore predicted system behavior between the subjective
   world of emotion and the objective world of the signal. This paper also
   compares various classifiers of emotion recognition, and then applies
   two sets of classifiers. The unsupervised classification include DBN,
   the supervised classification include Bayesclassifier and
   Fisherclassifier and SVM. The DNB method performed better than SVM in
   classification accruracy, and the Bayesclassifier is better than
   Fisherclassifier in run time. DBN has a higher classification accuracy
   and lower standard deviation, more suitable for EEG emotion recognition.}},

Title = {{An end-to-end deep learning approach to MI-EEG signal classification for
   BCIs}},

Abstract = {{Goal: To develop and implement a Deep Learning (DL) approach for an
   electroencephalogram (EEG) based Motor Imagery (MI) Brain-Computer
   Interface (BCI) system that could potentially be used to improve the
   current stroke rehabilitation strategies.
   Method: The DL model is using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) layers
   for learning generalized features and dimension reduction, while a
   conventional Fully Connected (FC) layer is used for classification.
   Together they build a unified end-to-end model that can be applied to
   raw EEG signals. This previously proposed model was applied to a new set
   of data to validate its robustness against data variations. Furthermore,
   it was extended by subject-specific adaptation. Lastly, an analysis of
   the learned filters provides insights into how such a model derives a
   classification decision.
   Results: The selected global classifier reached 80.38\%, 69.82\%, and
   58.58\% mean accuracies for datasets with two, three, and four classes,
   respectively, validated using 5-fold crossvalidation. As a novel
   approach in this context, transfer learning was used to adapt the global
   classifier to single individuals improving the overall mean accuracy to
   86.49\%, 79.25\%, and 68.51\%, respectively. The global models were
   trained on 3s segments of EEG data from different subjects than they
   were tested on, which proved the generalization performance of the
   model.
   Conclusion: The results are comparable with the reported accuracy values
   in related studies and the presented model outperforms the results in
   the literature on the same underlying data. Given that the model can
   learn features from data without having to use specialized feature
   extraction methods, DL should be considered as an alternative to
   established EEG classification methods, if enough data is available. (C)

Title = {{Shenfu Formula reduces cardiomyocyte apoptosis in heart failure rats by
   regulating microRNAs}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY}},

Volume = {{227}},

Abstract = {{Ethnopharmacological relevance: Shenfu decoction consists of the water
   extract from the dried root or rootstalk of Panax ginseng C. A. Mey
   (Asian ginseng) and the lateral root of Aconitum carmichaeli Debx (Fuzi,
   Heishunpian in Chinese). Shenfu Formula has been used as a folk Chinese
   medicine for thousands of years. Recent studies have shown that Shenfu
   injection can enhance cardiac function and regulate arrhythmia.
   Aim of the study: Shenfu Formula plays an important role in the
   treatment of heart failure. However, its microRNA-mediated mechanisms
   are still not fully understood. Thus, we established a heart failure
   model in rats to investigate the microRNA mechanism of Shenfu Formula in
   cardiac function and apoptosis.
   Materials and methods: The heart failure animal model was established
   via left-anterior descending coronary artery ligation in rats. Seven
   days after surgery, Shenfu Formula was given to the heart failure rats,
   which were selected by echocardiography with an LVEF < 45\%. After
   Shenfu Formula was given intragastrically for 30 days, blood samples
   were drawn, the heart was excised after echocardiography, and
   echocardiographic parameters and apoptosis-related proteins were further
   examined. Fas/Fas-L and Bcl-2/Bax proteins were analyzed by Western
   blot, and microRNAs were evaluated using Affymetrix GeneChip miRNA
   arrays.
   Results: Shenfu Formula increased the left ventricular ejection
   fraction, improved the hemodynamic index of heart failure rats, and
   decreased serum brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels. Shenfu Formula
   also decreased the positive rate of myocardial cells as detected by the
   TUNEL method and significantly suppressed caspase 3 expression.
   Moreover, we found that Shenfu Formula can regulate the initiative
   factors Fas/Fas-L in the intrinsic pathway and Bcl-2/Bax in the
   extrinsic apoptosis pathway to suppress apoptosis in heart failure rats.
   Finally, Shenfu Formula potentially alters the balance of microRNAs
   involved in activating and inhibiting apoptosis, ultimately suppressing
   apoptosis; this leads to changes in the gene expression profiles of
   microRNAs targets.
   Conclusion: Shenfu Granule can effectively improve cardiac function in
   heart failure rats, and the anti-apoptosis effects of Shenfu Formula are
   potential mechanisms for inhibiting heart failure.}},

Title = {{Neurophysiological predictors and spectro-spatial discriminative
   features for enhancing SMR-BCI}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2018}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Neural engineering research is actively engaged in optimizing the
   robustness of sensorimotor rhythms (SMR)-brain-computer interface (BCI)
   to boost its potential real-world use. Objective. This paper
   investigates two vital factors in efficient and robust SMR-BCI
   design-algorithms that address subject-variability of optimal features
   and neurophysiological factors that correlate with BCI performance.
   Existing SMR-BCI research using electroencephalogram (EEG) to classify
   bilateral motor imagery (MI) focus on identifying subject-specific
   frequency bands with most discriminative motor patterns localized to
   sensorimotor region. Approach. A novel strategy to further optimize BCI
   performance by taking into account the variability of discriminative
   spectral regions across various EEG channels is proposed in this paper.
   Main results. The proposed technique results in a significant (p <
   0.007) increase in average (N = 10) classification accuracy by 5.96\%
   accompanied by a considerable reduction in number of channels and bands.
   The session-to-session transfer variation in spectro-spatial patterns
   using proposed algorithm is investigated offline and classification
   performance of the optimized BCI model is successfully evaluated in an
   online SMR-BCI. Further, the effective prediction of SMR-BCI performance
   with physiological indicators derived from multi-channel resting-state
   EEG is demonstrated. The results indicate that the resting state
   activation patterns such as entropy and gamma power from pre-motor
   (fronto-central) and posterior (parietal and centro-parietal) areas, and
   beta power from posterior (centro-parietal) areas estimate BCI
   performance with minimum error. These patterns, strongly related to BCI
   performance, may represent certain cognitive states during rest.
   Significance. Findings reported in this paper imply the need for
   subject-specific modelling of BCI and the prediction of BCI performance
   using multi-channel rest-state parameters, to ensure enhanced BCI
   performance.}},

Title = {{Compact convolutional neural networks for classification of asynchronous
   steady-state visual evoked potentials}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective. Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) are neural
   oscillations from the parietal and occipital regions of the brain that
   are evoked from flickering visual stimuli. SSVEPs are robust signals
   measurable in the electroencephalogram (EEG) and are commonly used in
   brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, methods for high-accuracy
   decoding of SSVEPs usually require hand-crafted approaches that leverage
   domain-specific knowledge of the stimulus signals, such as specific
   temporal frequencies in the visual stimuli and their relative spatial
   arrangement. When this knowledge is unavailable, such as when SSVEP
   signals are acquired asynchronously, such approaches tend to fail.
   Approach. In this paper, we show how a compact convolutional neural
   network (Compact-CNN), which only requires raw EEG signals for automatic
   feature extraction, can be used to decode signals from a 12-class SSVEP
   dataset without the need for user-specific calibration. Main results.
   The Compact-CNN demonstrates across subject mean accuracy of
   approximately 80\%, out-performing current state-of-the-art,
   hand-crafted approaches using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and
   Combined-CCA. Furthermore, the Compact-CNN approach can reveal the
   underlying feature representation, revealing that the deep learner
   extracts additional phase-and amplitude-related features associated with
   the structure of the dataset. Significance. We discuss how our
   Compact-CNN shows promise for BCI applications that allow users to
   freely gaze/attend to any stimulus at any time (e.g. asynchronous BCI)
   as well as provides a method for analyzing SSVEP signals in a way that
   might augment our understanding about the basic processing in the visual
   cortex.}},

Title = {{Muscle-selective disinhibition of corticomotor representations using a
   motor imagery-based brain-computer interface}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{183}},
Pages = {{597-605}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Bridging between brain activity and machine control, brain-computer
   interface (BCI) can be employed to activate distributed neural circuits
   implicated in a specific aspect of motor control. Using a motor
   imagery-based BCI paradigm, we previously found a disinhibition within
   the primary motor cortex contralateral to the imagined movement, as
   evidenced by event-related desynchronization (ERD) of oscillatory
   cortical activity. Yet it is unclear whether this BCI approach does
   selectively facilitate corticomotor representations targeted by the
   imagery. To address this question, we used brain state-dependent
   transcranial magnetic stimulation while participants performed
   kinesthetic motor imagery of wrist movements with their right hand and
   received online visual feedback of the ERD. Single and paired-pulse
   magnetic stimulation were given to the left primary motor cortex at a
   low or high level of ERD to assess intracortical excitability. While
   intracortical facilitation showed no modulation by ERD, short-latency
   intracortical inhibition was reduced the higher the ERD. Intracortical
   disinhibition was only found in the agonist muscle targeted by motor
   imagery at high ERD level, but not in the antagonist muscle. Single
   pulse motor-evoked potential was also increased the higher the ERD.
   However, at high ERD level, this facilitatory effect on overall
   corticospinal excitability was not selective to the agonist muscle.
   Analogous results were found in two independent experiments, in which
   participants either performed kinesthetic motor imagery of wrist
   extension or flexion. Our results showed that motor imagery-based BCI
   can selectively disinhibit the corticomotor output to the agonist
   muscle, enabling effector-specific training in patients with motor
   paralysis.}},

Title = {{The influence of prior pronunciations on sensorimotor cortex activity
   patterns during vowel production}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective. In recent years, brain-computer interface (BCI) systems have
   been investigated for their potential as a communication device to
   assist people with severe paralysis. Decoding speech sensorimotor cortex
   activity is a promising avenue for the generation of BCI control
   signals, but is complicated by variability in neural patterns, leading
   to suboptimal decoding. We investigated whether neural pattern
   variability associated with sound pronunciation can be explained by
   prior pronunciations and determined to what extent prior speech affects
   BCI decoding accuracy. Approach. Neural patterns in speech motor areas
   were evaluated with electrocorticography in five epilepsy patients, who
   performed a simple speech task that involved pronunciation of the /i/
   sound, preceded by either silence, the /a/ sound or the /u/ sound. Main
   results. The neural pattern related to the /i/ sound depends on previous
   sounds and is therefore associated with multiple distinct sensorimotor
   patterns, which is likely to reflect differences in the movements
   towards this sound. We also show that these patterns still contain a
   commonality that is distinct from the other vowel sounds (/a/ and /u/).
   Classification accuracies for the decoding of different sounds do
   increase, however, when the multiple patterns for the /i/ sound are
   taken into account. Simply including multiple forms of the /i/ vowel in
   the training set for the creation of a single /i/ model performs as well
   as training individual models for each /i/ variation. Significance. Our
   results are of interest for the development of BCIs that aim to decode
   speech sounds from the sensorimotor cortex, since they argue that a
   multitude of cortical activity patterns associated with speech movements
   can be reduced to a basis set of models which reflect meaningful
   language units (vowels), yet it is important to account for the variety
   of neural patterns associated with a single sound in the training
   process.}},

Title = {{Gumpy: a Python toolbox suitable for hybrid brain-computer interfaces}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective. The objective of this work is to present gumpy, a new free
   and open source Python toolbox designed for hybrid brain-computer
   interface (BCI). Approach. Gumpy provides state-of-the-art algorithms
   and includes a rich selection of signal processing methods that have
   been employed by the BCI community over the last 20 years. In addition,
   a wide range of classification methods that span from classical machine
   learning algorithms to deep neural network models are provided. Gumpy
   can be used for both EEG and EMG biosignal analysis, visualization,
   real-time streaming and decoding. Results. The usage of the toolbox was
   demonstrated through two different offline example studies, namely
   movement prediction from EEG motor imagery, and the decoding of natural
   grasp movements with the applied finger forces from surface EMG (sEMG)
   signals. Additionally, gumpy was used for real-time control of a robot
   arm using steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) as well as for
   real-time prosthetic hand control using sEMG. Overall, obtained results
   with the gumpy toolbox are comparable or better than previously reported
   results on the same datasets. Significance. Gumpy is a free and open
   source software, which allows end-users to perform online hybrid BCIs
   and provides different techniques for processing and decoding of EEG and
   EMG signals. More importantly, the achieved results reveal that gumpy's
   deep learning toolbox can match or outperform the state-of-the-art in
   terms of accuracy. This can therefore enable BCI researchers to develop
   more robust decoding algorithms using novel techniques and hence chart a
   route ahead for new BCI improvements.}},

Title = {{Concurrent control of a brain-computer interface and natural overt

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective. A primary control signal in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs)
   have been cortical signals related to movement. However, in cases where
   natural motor function remains, BCI control signals may interfere with
   other possibly simultaneous activity for useful ongoing movement. We
   sought to determine if the brain could learn to control both a BCI and
   concurrent overt movement execution in such cases. Approach. We designed
   experiments where BCI and overt movements must be used concurrently and
   in coordination to achieve a 2D centre out control. Power in the 70-90
   Hz band of human electrocorticography (ECoG) signals, was used to
   generate BCI control commands for vertical movement of the cursor. These
   signals were deliberately recorded from the same human cortical site
   that produced the strongest movement related activity associated with
   the concurrent overt finger movements required for the horizontal
   movement of the cursor. Main results. We demonstrate that three subjects
   were able to perform the concurrent BCI task, controlling BCI and
   natural movements simultaneously and to a large extent independently. We
   conclude that the brain is capable of dissociating the original control
   signal dependency on movement, producing specific BCI control signals in
   the presence of motor related responses from the ongoing overt behaviour
   with which the BCI signal was initially correlated. Significance. We
   demonstrate a novel human brain-computer interface (BCI) which can be
   used to control movement concurrently and in coordination with movements
   of the natural limbs. This demonstrates the dissociation of cortical
   activity from the behaviour with which it was originally associated
   despite the ongoing behaviour and shows the feasibility of achieving
   simultaneous BCI control of devices with natural movements.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanism of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) evasion of host cell
   remains elusive. Several microRNAs that are involved in this complex
   process were identified. miRNA interference-based therapeutics
   represents an attractive challenge and shows huge potential for disorder
   treatment. In this study, we found that miR-124-3p expression is
   significantly decreased in microglia after Mycobacterium marinum (M.m)
   infection. To achieve better target transfection effect, a CD1lb
   antibody and PEI modified nanoparticles-based Nano platform had been
   developed. This system was equipped by conjugation of miRNA-124-3p onto
   the surface of nanoparticles with a PEI/CD11b antibody coating.
   Transfection with miR-124-3p promoted microglia apoptosis through
   upregulation of Caspase3 or downregulation of BcI-2 and Bcl-xl. More
   importantly, transfection with miR-124-3p inhibitor increases the
   mycobacterium proliferation in microglia. Based on the above, we further
   found miRNA-124-3p to bind to 3'untranslated region of Stat3, resulting
   in the downregulation of its protein to trigger cells apoptosis through
   Stat3-related pathway. As such, our research might provide new insights
   towards target delivering miRNA through the bold-brain barrier (BBB) and
   exploiting highly effective anti-tuberculous meningitis drugs. Taken
   together, our findings suggest how Mycobacterium can manipulate host
   miRNA expression to regulate cell survival for its own proliferation,
   and highlight the importance to develop novel therapeutic strategies
   against tuberculous meningitis.}},
